<h2>DWR (Direct Web Remoting)</h2>

<p>What DWR does for you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gives you a very very easy way to call Java code from your web-app.</li>
  <li>Gives you a jump-start to being able to create GMail type interactivity.</li>
</ul>

<p>What DWR does not do for you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be a servlet framework</li>
  <li>Make coffee</li>
  <li>Be a perfect solution. Consider this alpha.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps to getting DWR running in your web app:</h3>
<p>
  You can see a demo of DWR running <a href="http://eireneh.thorubio.org/dwr/dwr/">here</a>.
  This is just a quick hack demo, so it might go away without notice.
  DWR is far more impressive if you run is yourself ...
</p>

<h4>1. Copy the JAR file dwr.jar into the WEB-INF/lib directory of your webapp.</h4>
<p>
  The JAR file can be downloaded <a href="https://dwr.dev.java.net/files/documents/2427/9809/dwr.jar">using the files area</a>,
  or <a href="https://dwr.dev.java.net/source/browse/dwr/">from CVS</a>, or you can build it yourself using the source from CVS.
</p>

<h4>2. Add the following lines to your WEB-INF/web.xml</h4>
<pre>
  &lt;servlet>
    &lt;servlet-name>dwr-invoker&lt;/servlet-name>
    &lt;display-name>DWR Servlet&lt;/display-name>
    &lt;description>Direct Web Remoter Servlet&lt;/description>
    &lt;servlet-class>uk.ltd.getahead.dwr.DWRServlet&lt;/servlet-class>
      &lt;init-param>
         &lt;param-name>allowed&lt;/param-name>
         &lt;param-value>
           uk.ltd.getahead.dwr.test.Test
           java.util.Date
         &lt;/param-value>
         &lt;description>What classes do we allow access to?&lt;/description>
      &lt;/init-param>
      &lt;init-param>
         &lt;param-name>debug&lt;/param-name>
         &lt;param-value>true&lt;/param-value>
         &lt;description>Do we startup in debug/test mode?&lt;/description>
      &lt;/init-param>
      &lt;load-on-startup>-1&lt;/load-on-startup>
  &lt;/servlet>
  &lt;servlet-mapping>
    &lt;servlet-name>dwr-invoker&lt;/servlet-name>
    &lt;url-pattern>/dwr/*&lt;/url-pattern>
  &lt;/servlet-mapping>
</pre>
<p>
  Note that in the next release of DWR we will be moving to using a simple
  dwr.xml file to configure the allowed beans, however for now you have to use
  web.xml.
</p>
<p>
  You can change the <i>allowed</i> init-param to specify any classes you want, so long
  as they satisfy the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The class must have a public no-args constructor like any normal Java Bean</li>
  <li>Avoid classes called by reserved JavaScript words. (methods called by reserved words are automatically excluded)</li>
  <li>There must be a way of converting from a string to all the parameter types. Currently the Coercer class converts Strings and all primitive types.</li>
  <li>Overridden methods will be involved in a bit of a lottery as to which gets called, so avoid overridden methods.</li>
  <li>Although you can allow several classes with the name last name component (like java.util.Date and java.sql.Date) you can't use them both in the same page.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Go to the following URL</h4>

<code>http://localhost:8080/[YOUR-WEBAPP]/dwr</code>
<p>
  You should see a page showing you the classes that you've selected in step 2.
  Having followed a link you should see an index of all the methods all ready for
  calling.
</p>
<p>Kick the tyres and have a look around.</p>
<p>To see more of how it works add the following lines to your web.xml</p>
<pre>
      &lt;init-param>
         &lt;param-name>debug&lt;/param-name>
         &lt;param-value>true&lt;/param-value>
         &lt;description>Do we begin in debug mode&lt;/description>
      &lt;/init-param>
</pre>
<p>This will prevent the Javascript from deleting the iframes that it creates</p>

<h4>4. How to make use of this from your web application</h4>

<p>
  Best practice is to have a class or 2 built to be called by DWR, this
  helps meet the marshalling requirements above and can help making thing secure
  (see below).
</p>
<p>
  The best way to get started is to nick the code from the pages that you have
  just looked at:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Go to http://localhost:8080/[YOUR-WEBAPP]/dwr and click on you class</li>
  <li>View source and find the line that executes the method that you are interested in.</li>
  <li>Paste the text into an HTML or JSP page in your web-app.</li>
  <li>Include links to the javascript files that make the magic happen:
<pre>
&lt;script src='/[YOUR-WEBAPP]/dwr/interface/[YOUR-CLASS].js'>&lt;/script>
&lt;script src='/[YOUR-WEBAPP]/dwr/engine.js'>&lt;/script>
</pre>
</li>
  <li>You will probably need to customize the Javascript to fit your site.</li>
  <li>Dance the funky chicken (optional).</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you need to access the HttpServletRequest or any of the other servlet
  classes you can do so using the ExecutionContext class. The code looks
  something like this:
</p>
<pre>
import uk.ltd.getahead.dwr.ExecutionContext;
req = ExecutionContext.getExecutionContext().getHttpServletRequest();
</pre>
<p>
  ExecutionContext uses a ThreadLocal variable so you can use the line above
  anywhere in your code (so long as it has been fired off by DWR).
</p>

<h4>5. THINK ABOUT SECURITY</h4>
<p>
  There is a danger that you could cause all sorts of security problems using this
  code. You need to think about security earlier rather than later.
</p>
<p>
  It makes sense to write your classes with DWR in mind thinking about the
  restrictions in step 2 above. Don't accidentally include methods that would
  allow an attacker to do too more that you wanted.
</p>
<p>
  Access to dwr can be restricted using the declaritive security built into the
  servlet spec.
</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>
  The JavaBeans you write will function a bit like Stateless Session EJBs. The
  differences are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>DWR has no complex deployment and can be run from Tomcat without needing a full EJB server</li>
  <li>DWR is called directly from JavaScript without needing a separate web framework</li>
  <li>DWR does not do transactions or security but there are 101 frameworks that will give you those things.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Due to security restrictions in browsers the site hosting the HTML pages must
  be the same as the site with the webapp. You can't have one web-server giving
  out HTML that directs the browser to request Javascript pages from another.
