<h1>Javascript Functions</h1>

<p>
  DWR includes 2 javascript files:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;script type='text/javascript' src='/[YOUR-WEB-APP]/dwr/engine.js'>&lt;/script>
  &lt;script type='text/javascript' src='/[YOUR-WEB-APP]/dwr/util.js'>&lt;/script>
</pre>
<p>
  The engine script file contains some functions that help define how DWR works.
  The util script file contains some useful stuff that could give you a good
  kick start in creating select lists and tables using DWR. util.js is totally
  unsupported however. If you wish to make use of it I suggest that you copy
  it into your webapp and use it from there. It may well go away in the future.
  The useful functions in engine.js are documented here. There is no
  documentation other than the demo pages for util.js
</p>

<h2>dwrSetErrorHandler</h2>
<p>
  Whenever there some sort of server failure DWR calls the error handler and
  passes it the error message. The default behavior if there is no error handler
  is to <code>alert(message);</code>.
  <br/>
  This method could be used to move the error messages from an alert box to the
  status bar or to do away with them altogether.
</p>

<h2>dwrSetPreHook</h2>
<p>
  If you wish to be alerted before DWR actually remotes a call you can set a
  pre-hook function. This will be called with no parameters.
  This hook is useful if you wish to grey out certain components to prevent them
  being used again until the call returns.
</p>

<h2>dwrSetPostHook</h2>
<p>
  Post execute hooks will usually be set in conjunction with pre-execute hooks
  and will generally undo any changes made by the pre-hook.
