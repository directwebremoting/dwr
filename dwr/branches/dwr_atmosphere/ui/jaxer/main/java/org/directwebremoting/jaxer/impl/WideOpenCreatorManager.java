/**
 * This is a modification of {@link DefaultCreatorManager} that attempts to do
 * a second round of configuration to allow direct access to any classes in the
 * system using a script name something like: creator/com/example/ClassName
 * <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> This class fundamentally breaks the DWR promise
 * of "we won't touch any of your code without your express permission". You
 * should only configure this class if you fully understand the implications of
 * doing so.
 * <p>This class was created to allow remoting between Jaxer and DWR for scripts
 * marked <code>runat="server"</code>. This should ensure that the exported
 * classes are not available to the outside world.
