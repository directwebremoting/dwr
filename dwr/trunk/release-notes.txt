RELEASE NOTES
=============

This file contains partially formed release notes for the 3.0 RC3 version.
Many changes will have been properly recorded in the bug tracking system.

Potentially Breaking Changes
----------------------------

3.0 RC3:
  * The AMD module format introduced in 3.0 RC2 has changed path mapping from /commonjs/amd to /amd (all references to CommonJS 
    AMD has been replaced with just AMD due to the AMD specification being split off from CommonJS).

3.0 RC2:
  * engine.js must now be included before any DWR interface scripts.
  * New CSRF algorithm that uses DWRSESSIONID cookie instead of JSESSIONID.
  * If you are using Jetty 6 with reverse AJAX you will need to either upgrade to Jetty 7+ or follow the directions here:
    http://www.butterdev.com/dwr/2010/01/dwr-3-x-and-jetty-continuations-on-jetty-6-x/.  Due to changes in the Jetty Continuation
    API.
