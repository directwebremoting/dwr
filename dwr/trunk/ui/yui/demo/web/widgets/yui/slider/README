0.12.1

   * Removed unneccessary getXY calls that were contribuing to slower performance
     in FireFox when the slider was deeply nested in the DOM.

0.12.0

   * Added "slideStart", "slideEnd", and "change" custom events.  The abstract
     methods these will eventually replace still work.

   * The default animation duration is 0.2 seconds (reduced from 0.4 seconds),
     and is configurable via the animationDuration property.

   * Keyboard navigation is now built in.  The background needs a tabindex for
     keyboard nav to work.  Keyboard nav can be disabled by setting enableKeys
     to false.  The number of pixels the slider moves when the arrow keys
     are pressed is controlled by keyIncrement, and defaults to 20.  Note, 
     Safari support limited to background element types that support focus
     in that browser. http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7138
