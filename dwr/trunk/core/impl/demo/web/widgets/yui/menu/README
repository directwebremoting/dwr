*** version 2.2.2 ***

Fixed the following bugs:
-------------------------

+ "toString" method of MenuItem, MenuBarItem and ContextMenuItem classes will
  no longer throw a JavaScript error when using the debug version 
  of the Event utility.

+ "toString" method of Menu, MenuBar and ContextMenu classes will
  no longer attempt to output the instance's id if it is not available.

+ Logger statements output by debug version of MenuManager are now properly 
  categorized as "MenuManager"



*** version 2.2.1 ***

Added the following features:
-----------------------------

+ Added the following methods to YAHOO.widget.Menu:
  - "focus"
  - "blur"
  - "hasFocus"

+ Added the following Custom Events to YAHOO.widget.Menu:
    + "focusEvent"
    + "blurEvent"

+ Added the following methods to YAHOO.widget.MenuManager:
  - "getFocusedMenuItem"
  - "getFocusedMenu"

+ Added "hasFocus" method to YAHOO.widget.MenuItem


Fixed the following bugs:
-------------------------

+ Menu instances no longer set focus to themselves by default when made 
  visible.  Menus only receive focus in response to the following events: 
    - The user mouses down on a MenuItem instance
    - The user tabs into a MenuItem instance

+ Application of the "maxheight" configuration property is now correctly 
  deferred until the "render" event fires when Menu instance is being 
  lazy loaded.

+ The "maxheight" configuration property can now be set multiple times without 
  a Menu instance restoring itself to its original default height.

+ The "maxheight" configuration property can now be set on hidden Menu 
  instances that use lazy loading. 

+ Menu instances with a "width" configuration property set will now render 
  at the specified width rather than shrink wrapping to their contents.

+ Menu item help text no longer wraps to the next line in Opera 9.

+ Immediate submenus of a Menubar instance will no longer shift their position 
  to try and remain inside the confines of the browser's viewport.

+ Lazy loaded ContextMenu instances now appear in the correct position when 
  they are made visible for the first time.

+ MenuBar instances no longer throw JavaScript errors when navigating items with
  submenus containing no active items using the keyboard.

+ Replaced use of native "hasOwnProperty" method 
  with YAHOO.lang.hasOwnProperty.

+ Rendered Menu instances will now update their width when items are added 
  or removed.

+ Mousing over a Menu instance in an IE window that does not have focus will 
  no longer cause the window to receive focus.


Changes:
--------

+ "activeItem" property of YAHOO.widget.Menu now returns a reference to the 
  Menu's currently selected item.

+ Added a "visible" CSS class that is applied to visible Menu instances.

+ Refactored the Menu family to improve performance, especially when working 
  with a large number of instances in IE6.



*** version 2.2.0 ***

Added the following features:
-----------------------------

* Added two new methods to YAHOO.widget.Menu:

    * "getItems" - Returns a flat array of the items in a menu.

    * "clearContent" - Removes all of the content from the menu, including the 
      menu items, group titles, header and footer.


* Added three new configuration attributes to YAHOO.widget.Menu:

    * "submenuhidedelay" - Number indicating the time (in milliseconds) that 
      should expire before a submenu is hidden when the user mouses out of a 
      menu item heading in the direction of a submenu. The value must be 
      greater than or equal to the value specified for the "showdelay" 
      configuration property.

    * "maxheight" - Defines the maximum height (in pixels) for a menu before 
      the contents of the body are scrolled. 

    * "classname" - CSS class to be applied to the menu's root <div> element. 
      The specified class(es) are appended in addition to the default class as 
      specified by the menu's CSS_CLASS_NAME constant.


* Added new constants to YAHOO.widget.MenuItem:

    * COLLAPSED_SUBMENU_INDICATOR_TEXT - String representing the text for the 
      <em> element used for the submenu arrow indicator.

    * EXPANDED_SUBMENU_INDICATOR_TEXT - String representing the text for the 
      submenu arrow indicator element (<em>) when the submenu is visible.

    * DISABLED_SUBMENU_INDICATOR_ALT_TEXT - String representing the text for 
      the submenu arrow indicator element (<em>) when the menu item is disabled.

    * CHECKED_TEXT - String representing the text to be used for the checked 
      indicator element (<em>).

    * DISABLED_CHECKED_TEXT - String representing the text to be used for the 
      checked indicator element (<em>) when the menu item is disabled.


* Added two new configuration attributes to YAHOO.widget.MenuItem:

    * "onclick" - Object literal representing the code to be executed when the 
      button is clicked. Format:

        {
            fn: Function, // The handler to call when the event fires.
            obj: Object, // An object to pass back to the handler.
            scope: Object // The object to use for the scope of the handler.
        }
    
    * "classname" - CSS class to be applied to the menu item's root <li> 
      element. The specified class(es) are appended in addition to the default 
      class as specified by the menu item's CSS_CLASS_NAME constant.


* Added an "id" property to YAHOO.widget.MenuItem that represents the id of
  the menu item's root <li> node.  Although not a configuration attribute, this
  property should be set via the object literal of configuration attributes 
  passed as the second argument to the constructor.  If no value is 
  specified, then one will be generated using the "generateId" method of the 
  Dom utility (YAHOO.widget.Dom).

* Added a "trigger context menu event" 
  (YAHOO.widget.ContextMenu.triggerContextMenuEvent) that fires when the DOM 
  "contextmenu" event ("mousedown" for Opera) is fired by one of the elemeents
  defined as a YAHOO.widget.ContextMenu instance's trigger.

* Added a "cancel" method to YAHOO.widget.ContextMenu that can be used to 
  cancel the display of a YAHOO.widget.ContextMen instance.  This method 
  should be called within the scope of a "context menu" event handler for 
  one of the context menu's triggers 
  (YAHOO.widget.ContextMenu.triggerContextMenuEvent).


Fixed the following bugs:
-------------------------

* Users can now move diagonally from a menu item to its corresponding submenu 
  without the submenu hiding immediately.

* "destroy" method of YAHOO.widget.Menu now unsubscribes from the "text resize"

* No changes



*** version 0.12.1 ***

Fixed the following bugs:

  a zero-second timeout to resolve a race condition between menu positioning 
  and focusing of a menu item that resulted in the browser viewport 
  scrolling unnecessarily.

* Switched to JSMin for JavaScript compression to resolve issues with the 
  minified version.  

* Disabled menu item instances will no longer display a submenu if the item is 
  clicked or moused over.

* Added a "toString" method to YAHOO.widget.MenuItem, YAHOO.widget.MenuBarItem 
  and YAHOO.widget.ContextMenuItem that returns the class name followed by the 
  value of the item's "text" configuration property.


Fixed the following bugs:
-------------------------

* Setting a YAHOO.widget.ContextMenu instance's "trigger" configuration 
  property will remove all previous triggers before setting up the new ones.

    * Element id
    * Element reference

* "hide" and "show" methods of statically positioned menus now toggle the their

*** version 0.10.0 ***

* Initial release

* Known issues:

      * Some Firefox extensions disable the ability for JavaScript to prevent  
        the display of the browser's default context menu.  These extensions
        can cause the YUI ContextMenu to stop working.  If you encounter this 
        problem, you can reset the context menu preference in Firefox back to 
        the default by making sure the "Disable or replace context menus" 
        preference is checked:

            Mac Firefox 1.0: 
            -------------------
            Preferences > Web Features > 
                Advanced... > Disable or replace context menus

            Mac Firefox 1.5
            -------------------
            Preferences > Context > 
                Advanced... > Disable or replace context menus

            Windows Firefox 1.0
            -------------------
            Tools > Options > Web Features > 
                Advanced... > Disable or replace context menus

            Windows Firefox 1.5
            -------------------
            Tools > Options > Context > 
                Advanced... > Disable or replace context menus



*** version 0.11.3 ***

Added the following features:
-----------------------------

* Added a "target" configuration property to the MenuModuleItem object that
  allows the user to specify the target of an item's anchor element.  Items 
  that make use of the "target" configuration property will require the user 
  to click exactly on the item's anchor element to navigate to the specified 
  URL.

* Items without a "url" property set will automatically hide their parent 
  menu instance(s) when clicked.


Fixed the following bugs:
-------------------------

* Items in a submenu should now navigate to their specified URL when clicked.

* Removed MenuBar's use of "overflow:hidden."  This fixes an issue in Firefox
  1.5 in which submenus of a Menubar instance cannot overlay other absolutely 
  positioned elements on the page.

* Submenus of a Menubar instance will now automatically have their iframe shim
  enabled in IE<7.

* Statically positioned Menubar and Menu instances will now render with the 
  correct position and dimensions in Safari.

* MenuModuleItem's "focus" method now checks to make sure that an item's 
  "display" style property is not "none" before trying to set focus to its
  anchor element.
  
* A ContextMenu instance will now hide all other ContextMenu instances before
  displaying itself.

* Removed the dead space in front of an item's submenu indicator image in IE.  
  This space was causing an item's submenu to flicker when the user hovered 
  over it.


Changes:
--------

* Moved the DOM event handlers for every menu from the root DIV node of each 
  instance to the document object.  This change reduces the number of DOM event 
  handlers used by Menu to eight, improving the cleanup time required by the 
  Event utility.

                

*** version 0.11.0 ***

Added the following features:
-----------------------------
* Overloaded the "addItem" and "insertItem" methods of MenuModule to accept a 
  string or a MenuModuleItem instance

* Added the ability to define a MenuItem instance as being "checked"


Fixed the following bugs:
-------------------------
* Changing the path for the submenu indicator image of one MenuModuleItem 
  subclass will no longer affect other subclasses

* MenuItem instances built from existing markup without anchor tags will no 
  longer trigger a JavaScript error when clicked

* Modified the implementation of the "imageRoot" property for the 
  MenuModuleItem class so that it is set to a secure/non-secure path when the
  object is instantiated

* Menu instances now resize in response to changes to the browser's font size

* Modified the propagation of the MenuModule class's "submenualignment" 
  configuration property so that it only applies to instances of the same type

* Adjusted the specificity of the style rule that controls the position of a 
  MenuItem instance's submenu indicator image to prevent it from wrapping in IE

* Specified a width and height for submenu indicator images in the Menu 
  stylesheet to ensure that Menu instances are always rendered at the correct 
  width

* Clicking a MenuItem instance will no longer trigger two HTTP GET requests

* Users can now control or shift-click on MenuItem links


Changes:
--------
* In the Menu stylesheet (menu.css), switched from using "first" class to
  "first-of-type" class

* Changed case of MenuModuleItem class's "subMenuIndicator" property 
  to "submenuIndicator"
