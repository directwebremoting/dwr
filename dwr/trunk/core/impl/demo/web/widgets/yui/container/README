Container Release Notes

*** version 2.2.2 ***

+ Clicking the close button of a Panel (or any instance of a Panel subclass) 
  registered with an OverlayManager will no longer result in the Panel 
  receiving focus.

+ Overlay instances registered with an OverlayManager will now correctly 
  blur themselves when hidden.

+ Calling the "destroy" method of an Overlay instance will now result in it 
  being removed from its OverlayManager instance(s).

+ The DOM event listener for the event defined by the "focusevent" 
  configuration property of an OverlayManager instance is now removed from each 
  Overlay instance when it is removed from its OverlayManager.

+ All subscribers for an Overlay instance's "focus" and "blur" events are 
  now unsubscribed when it is removed from its OverlayManager.


*** version 2.2.1 ***

+ Made the default scope for all Custom Events published by Module, Overlay, 
  Panel, Tooltip, Dialog and SimpleDialog the widget instance.  Previously the 
  default scope for Custom Events was inconsistent across classes; the default
  scope for Custom Events published by Overlay was always the Overlay instance
  whereas the Custom Events published by all of the other classes had no 
  default scope.  

+ Added default scope for CustomEvents published by YAHOO.util.Config:
  - Default scope for the "configChangedEvent" is now the Config instance.
  - Default scope for Config property events is now the Config's owner (widget).

+ Panel and Tooltip now always convert the value of a DOM element's "tagName" 
  property to uppercase before evaluating it.  This improves 
  XHTML compatibility.
  
+ Pressing the enter key while focused on a form field inside a Dialog will 
  now trigger the "click" event handler defined by the Dialog's default 
  button in IE and Firefox.  Previously, this behavior only worked in Safari 
  and Opera.

+ Added a "yui" prefix to the default CSS class name for Module to be 
  consistent with the other Container family widgets.

+ Container/Panel's underlay shadow is now defined as partially-transparent
  black rather than gray.  This prevents the shadow from lightening the 
  background color of elements beneath it.

+ Fixed memory leaks in Panel and Dialog.

+ The Drag and Drop library is now a truly optional dependency for Panel and its 
  subclasses.

+ Panel "focus" and "blur" events are now fired when Panels are focused and 
  blurred via the "focus" and "blurAll" methods of YAHOO.widget.OverlayManager.

+ Panel instances rendered without setting the value for the "width" 
  configuration property will now have their "width" configuration 
  property set to the value of the Panel's element's "offsetWidth" property 
  when rendered.  This fixes an issue in IE 6 and 7 where Panels that are 
  rendered without setting the "width" configuration property will only be 
  draggable by mousing down on the text inside the header, rather than anywhere 
  inside the header.
  
+ Refactored the Container family including the Config class to improve 
  performance, especially when working with a large number of instances in IE6.
