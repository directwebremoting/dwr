<h2>Fixing Issues</h2>

<h3><a name="missingConverter">Warning: No Converter for XXX.</a></h3>
<p>
  dwr.xml does not have an allow entry that enables conversion of this type to
  Javascript. The most common cause of this problem is that XXX is a java bean
  and bean marshalling has not been enabled. Bean marshalling is disabled by
  default for security reasons.
</p>
<p>
  To enable marshalling for a given bean add the following line to the allow
  section of your dwr.xml file:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;convert converter="bean" match="XXX"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  It is also possible to enable marshalling for an entire package or hierachy
  of packages using the following:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;convert converter="bean" match="package.name.*"/&gt;
</pre>

<h3><a name="overloadedMethod">Warning: overloaded methods are not recommended</a></h3>
<p>
  Javascript does not support overloaded methods, so the javascript file
  generated from this class will contain two methods the second of which will
  replace the first. This is probably not what you wanted.
</p>
<p>
  It is best to avoid overloaded methods when using DWR.
</p>

<h3><a name="excludedMethod">Warning: methodName() is excluded:</a></h3>
<p>
  The methods may be excluded explicitly with an &lt;exclude&gt; element in
  dwr.xml or excluded implicitly by not being mentioned in an &lt;include&gt;
  element. Or the method may be defined in <code>java.lang.Object</code> -
  methods defined here may not be exported.
</p>
<p>
  If methods are excluded using &lt;include&gt; or &lt;exclude&gt; then no
  JavaScript proxy will be generated. To allow testing of methods that should
  not be accessible, add an init-param to WEB-INF/web.xml with the name/value
  allowImpossibleTests=true.
