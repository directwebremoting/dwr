/**
 * A smart implementation of ServerLoadMonitor.
 *
 * <p>What a browser does:</p>
 * <pre>
 *       connected disconnected connected ...
 *      ____________          ____________
 *      |          |          |          |
 *      |          |          |          |
 * _____|          |__________|          |______
 *       [---cT---] [---dT---] [---cT---] ...
 * </pre>
 * <p>Where cT is the connectedTime and dT is the disconnectedTime.</p>
 *
 * <p>We impose some limits: a maximum number of simultaneously connected
 * browsers <code>maxWaitingThreads</code>, and the maximum number of
 * connections per second <code>maxHitsPerSecond</code>.</p>
 *
 * <p>We attempt to keep the actual waitingThreads and hitsPerSecond within
 * bounds by varying connectedTime and disconnectedTime.</p>
 *
 * <p>The system is in one of 3 modes: USAGE_LOW, USAGE_HIGH and USAGE_DIGG. The
 * boundary between USAGE_LOW and USAGE_HIGH is called threadOut. The boundary
 * between USAGE_HIGH and USAGE_DIGG is called hitOut.</p>
 *
 * <p>The system starts in USAGE_LOW mode. This mode uses constant values of
 * connectedTime=60 secs and disconnectedTime=0 secs. We could use much bigger
 * values for connectedTime (like infinite) however the servlet spec does not
 * enable servlet engines to inform us if the browser goes away so we check by
 * asking the browser to reconnect periodically.</p>
 *
 * <p>In USAGE_LOW mode we measure the number of clients using the number of
 * concurrently connected browsers (waitingThreads), when this goes above
 * maxWaitingThreads we move into USAGE_HIGH mode.</p>
 *
 * <p>On entering USAGE_HIGH mode, the settings (initially) change to
 * connectedTime=49 secs and disconnectedTime=1 sec. As the load increases the
 * connectedTime decreases linearly from 49 secs down to prevent the hits per
 * second from going above maxHitsPerSecond. If the connectedTime goes below
 * 1sec then the mode switches to USAGE_DIGG. If the connectedTime goes above
 * 49 secs then mode switches to USAGE_LOW.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note: there is some danger of an overlap where the system toggles between
 * USAGE_HIGH and USAGE_LOW. We need some way to prevent this from happening.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>On entering USAGE_DIGG mode, the connectedTime changes to 0 secs, and the
 * disconnectedTime changes to 2 secs (to keep the round trip time at 2 secs).
 * The disconnectedTime alters to prevent the hitsPerSecond from going above
 * maxHitsPerSecond (In USAGE_HIGH mode the connectedTime was altered).
 * When the disconnectedTime would go under 2 secs, we switch back to USAGE_HIGH
 * mode.</p>
