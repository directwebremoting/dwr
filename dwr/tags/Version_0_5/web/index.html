<h1>DWR (Direct Web Remoting)</h1>

<p>What DWR does for you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    DWR is easy Ajax. XMLHttpRequest without any hassle.
    It makes it simple to call Java code directly from Javascript.
    It gets rid of almost all the boiler plate code between the web browser
    and your Java code.
    <br/>
    So you don't need to create servlets and web.xml entries for all your code,
    you don't need struts config files or JSF magic incantations, no writing
    Actions or implementing some special interface.
    Just you, DWR, Java, HTML and Javascript.
  </li>
  <li>
    DWR gives you a jump-start to being able to create GMail type interactivity.
    We are gradually moving to a web where more and more is done dynamically,
    and love it or lothe it that means Javascript. DWR makes the Javascript
    easier by giving you a set of examples of how to create dynamic sites.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What DWR does not do for you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    It is not a servlet framework. If you are already using Struts, JSF,
    Webwork or Spring, then DWR fits in just fine. It comes with Spring beans
    integration allowing you to remote your spring beans to Javascript.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Finding out more ...</h2>
<p>
  The project is hosted by Sun at
  <a href="https://dwr.dev.java.net">Java.net</a> which is also
  the best place for 
  <a href="https://dwr.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">downloads</a>
  and where the <a href="https://dwr.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">mailing lists</a>
  are hosted.
</p>

<p>
  DWR is open source, licensed under the ASL version 2.0, with full intention
  that it be GPL compatible.
</p>

<p>
  To help get started there is an
  <a href="intro.html">introduction documentation</a> on how to
  add the jar file to your webapp, and then
  <a href="config-howto.html">more detail on how to configure DWR</a> and a
  <a href="config-ref.html">reference section on dwr.xml</a>.
</p>

<p>
  There are 2 fairly static Javascript files in addition to the files that are
  generated dynamically from your Java classes. engine.js and util.js are
  <a href="config-js.html">documented</a>.
</p>

<h2>Worked Examples</h2>
<p>
  We have 4 working examples of using DWR to create:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="demo-text.html">Dynamic Text</a></li>
    <li><a href="demo-list.html">Selection Lists</a></li>
    <li><a href="demo-table.html">Live Tables</a></li>
    <li><a href="demo-form.html">Live Forms</a></li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Unit Tests</h2>
<p>
  If you are running these pages from your own server then you will also find
  a working <a href="test.html">unit test page</a>. It won't work from my site
  because I don't wish to stress my server too much with hundreds of people
  running the same tests over and over again.
</p>

<h2>Related Projects</h2>
<p>
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sarissa">Sarissa</a> is a
  cross-browser Javascript XML library. It contains better versions of some of
  the XML utilities in util.js. Don't look to Sarissa for remoting, but do look
  to it for better XML functions. Sarissa is GPL/LGPL.

<p>
  Both <a href="http://cross-browser.com/toys/">cross-browser.com</a> and
  <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/">quirksmode.org</a> contain useful
  cross-browser script libraries.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://oss.metaparadigm.com/jsonrpc/">JSON-RPC-Java</a> does a
  similar job to DWR. The main difference between JSON-RPC-Java and DWR is that
  JSON focuses on a standardized wire protocol so you can re-write your back
  end server and leave the browser as it is. DWR focuses on making remoting easy
  for both ends of the spectrum, Java and JavaScript.
