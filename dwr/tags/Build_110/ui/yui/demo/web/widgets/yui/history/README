YUI Library - History - Release Notes

2.2.2
  * No change

2.2.1

  * Use YAHOO.lang.hasOwnProperty when iterating over the _modules associative
    array. This way, the browser history manager will play nice with the
    libraries that add methods to the prototype of the Array object.
  * Fixed bug related to escaping / unescaping some values.
  * Added parameters to the register method to look like the addListener method
    of the Event utility (you can now pass an object that becomes the scope of
    the onStateChange handler, or is simply passed in to that handler)
  * Upgraded code presentation to work with Crockford's latest recommendations
    (which the latest version of JSLint online implements)
  * Integrated David Bloom's findings to not have to use an external asset
    (blank.html) on IE (when not going through HTTPS)

2.2.0

  * This is the initial release of the browser history manager.
