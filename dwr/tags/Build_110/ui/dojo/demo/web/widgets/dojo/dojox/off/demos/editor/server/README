This directory contains a server-side implementation of Moxie to 
illustrate how to create a full client/server application with Dojo Offline. 
It is built in Java, with a Java servlet. It comes bundled with an open-source, 
embedded web-server named Jetty and an embedded open-source database named 
Derby so that you can quickly run the server-side with one command. Further, 
you can use this scaffolding to easily and quickly begin creating the server-side 
of your own Dojo Offline-based applications.

Dependencies
------------

The Moxie server requires the following pieces of software to install:
* Java 1.5+ 

Building
------------------

A build.sh file is provided in this directory to build the server-side; it 
will only currently run on Unix-based machines (Mac OS X, Linux, etc.). 
However, the code has already been built, is bundled in this directory, 
and can be used immediately; only run the build.sh script if you want to 
tinker with the source code yourself.

Running
------------------

Running the server-side of Moxie is simple. Just type:

java -jar editor.jar

from this directory, and the Moxie server-side will start running, with an 
embedded web-server (Jetty) and database (Derby) already setup for you. 
In a web-browser, go to the following URL:

http://localhost:8000/dojox/off/demos/editor/editor.html

to run Moxie against your local server.
