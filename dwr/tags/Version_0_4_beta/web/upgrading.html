<h2>Upgrading to DWR 0.4</h2>
<p>
  web/WEB-INF/web.xml has a fully fleshed out example of the options for dwr.
  2 parameters (config and logLevel) you can safely ignore.
  The 3rd, debug, you should leave as true if you want the test/debug setup to
  work (this is what you are using below)
  I would suggest turning this off in live.
</p>

<p>
  Secondly you will need a dwr.xml file that does the job of the old allow
  parameter. By default it lives in WEB-INF/dwr.xml (there is an example in the
  web folder of this too)
  <br/>
  I suggest starting with the example in the web/WEB-INF folder and removing
  the &lt;init> section and for each allow have a
  &lt;create creator="new" javascript="Test" class="full.java.pkg.Test"/> tag.
  <br/>
  The different type of creators allow us to have different sources for the
  beans. <code>new</code> was all that existed in dwr 0.3. <code>session</code>
  gets the bean from the session (creating it if it does not exist).
  <code>spring</code> uses the spring framework and <code>static</code> works on
  static methods only.
  <br/>
  You can remove all the converter options in the allow section.
  By default all primitive types, arrays and Strings get converted without need
  for declaration. The system dwr file in <code>java/uk/ltd/getahead/dwr</code>
  might help you see what is going on a bit.
</p>

<p>
  There is one other breaking change, where in your html you were doing:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;script type='text/javascript' src='/XXX/dwr/interface/full.java.pkg.Test.js'></script>
</pre>
<p>
  You would need to do:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;script type='text/javascript' src='/XXX/dwr/interface/Test.js'></script>
</pre>
<p>
  Where Test is the value you specify in the javascript attribute in your create tag (see above).
