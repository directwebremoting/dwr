Make DWR ask for a scriptSessionID on first connect and do it in ordered mode.

json support

onbackbutton, onforwardbutton

DWRUtil.getValues should handle multiple select list

Simple Date format
	There are also notes here:
	http://getahead.ltd.uk/dwr/server/dwrxml/converters
	This is something that keeps on being mentioned. At some stage maybe we
	should consider creating a simple Javascript version of SimpleDateFormat
	that would help people get this job done more quickly.

Add checks for Javascript reserved names
	In using DWR one nasty issue I came across was that my bean had a property
	called default - my ajax call kept failing and I couldn't figure out why
	till I looked at the generated variables and saw that it was because the
	generated code put in a value for default and javascript didn't like it.
	Maybe as a warning, look at bean properties and see if there are a conflicts
	with reserved keywords.
