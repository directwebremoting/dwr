<h1>Configuration Manual</h1>

<h2>Details to add to your web.xml</h2>

<p>
  The minimum possible additions to your web.xml, are simply those to declare
  the DWR servlet without which none of this would work. So the least you can
  get away with looks something like this:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;servlet&gt;
  &lt;servlet-name&gt;dwr-invoker&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
  &lt;servlet-class&gt;uk.ltd.getahead.dwr.DWRServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
&lt;/servlet&gt;
&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
  &lt;servlet-name&gt;dwr-invoker&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
  &lt;url-pattern&gt;/dwr/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
</pre>

<p>
  In addition to this there are 3 servlet parameters that are somewhere between
  important and vaguely useful.
</p>

<h3>Using debug/test mode</h3>

<p>
  You put DWR into debug/test mode by adding the following parameter:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;init-param&gt;
  &lt;param-name&gt;debug&lt;/param-name&gt;
  &lt;param-value&gt;true&lt;/param-value&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;Do we startup in debug mode?&lt;/description&gt;
&lt;/init-param&gt;
</pre>

<p>
  DWR will generate test pages for each of the allowed classes (see dwr.xml below)
  in debug mode. These can be very useful in seeing what DWR can do and how it
  works. This mode can also alert you to problems like javascript reserved word
  clashes or overloading problems.
  <br/>
  However this mode should not be used in live deployment as it could give an
  attacker a lot of information about the services that you export. If you have
  designed your website properly then this extra information will not help an
  attacker exploit your website however it is generally wise not to give anyone
  a route map to exploit any mistakes you might have made.
  <br/>
  DWR is provided 'as is', without any warranty, so the security of your website
  is your responsibility. Please take care to keep it secure.
</p>

<h3>Multiple dwr.xml files and J2EE security</h3>

<p>
  Generally speaking you will only need one dwr.xml file and that will be in the
  default position: <code>WEB-INF/dwr.xml</code>. So you can leave this paramter
  out. If you do wish to use it then the syntax is as follows:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;init-param&gt;
  &lt;param-name&gt;config*****&lt;/param-name&gt;
  &lt;param-value&gt;WEB-INF/dwr.xml&lt;/param-value&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;What config file do we use?&lt;/description&gt;
&lt;/init-param&gt;
</pre>

<p>
  Where config***** means any param-name that begins with the string 'config'.
  This parameter can be specified as many times as required, however the
  <code>param-name</code> should be different for each.
</p>

<p>
  There are 3 reasons why you
  might wish to specify a different position for dwr.xml:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    You wish to keep dwr.xml with the files that it gives access to.
    In which case the section might have a param-value something like
    <code>&lt;param-value&gt;WEB-INF/classes/com/yourco/dwr/dwr.xml&lt;/param-value&gt;</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    You have a large number of remoted classes and wish to keep the
    definitions in separate files. In this case you will have the section
    above repeated several times each with a different <code>param-name</code>
    that begins 'config' and each with a different file.
    DWR will read them all in turn.
  </li>
  <li>
    DWR can use J2EE URL security built into the servlet spec to give
    different groups of users access to different functions. You simply define
    more than one dwr servlet by repeating the stanza at the top of the page
    with different names, urls and permissions. For example:
  </li>
</ul>

<pre>
&lt;servlet&gt;
  &lt;servlet-name&gt;dwr-user-invoker&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
  &lt;servlet-class&gt;uk.ltd.getahead.dwr.DWRServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
  &lt;init-param&gt;
    &lt;param-name&gt;config-user&lt;/param-name&gt;
    &lt;param-value&gt;WEB-INF/dwr-user.xml&lt;/param-value&gt;
  &lt;/init-param&gt;
&lt;/servlet&gt;
&lt;servlet&gt;
  &lt;servlet-name&gt;dwr-admin-invoker&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
  &lt;servlet-class&gt;uk.ltd.getahead.dwr.DWRServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
  &lt;init-param&gt;
    &lt;param-name&gt;config-admin&lt;/param-name&gt;
    &lt;param-value&gt;WEB-INF/dwr-admin.xml&lt;/param-value&gt;
  &lt;/init-param&gt;
&lt;/servlet&gt;
&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
  &lt;servlet-name&gt;dwr-admin-invoker&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
  &lt;url-pattern&gt;/dwradmin/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
  &lt;servlet-name&gt;dwr-user-invoker&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
  &lt;url-pattern&gt;/dwruser/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;

&lt;security-constraint&gt;
  &lt;display-name&gt;dwr-admin&lt;/display-name&gt;
  &lt;web-resource-collection&gt;
    &lt;web-resource-name&gt;dwr-admin-collection&lt;/web-resource-name&gt;
    &lt;url-pattern&gt;/dwradmin/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
  &lt;/web-resource-collection&gt;
  &lt;auth-constraint&gt;
    &lt;role-name&gt;admin&lt;/role-name&gt;
  &lt;/auth-constraint&gt;
&lt;/security-constraint&gt;
&lt;security-constraint&gt;
  &lt;display-name&gt;dwr-user&lt;/display-name&gt;
  &lt;web-resource-collection&gt;
    &lt;web-resource-name&gt;dwr-user-collection&lt;/web-resource-name&gt;
    &lt;url-pattern&gt;/dwruser/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
  &lt;/web-resource-collection&gt;
  &lt;auth-constraint&gt;
    &lt;role-name&gt;user&lt;/role-name&gt;
  &lt;/auth-constraint&gt;
&lt;/security-constraint&gt;
</pre>

<h3>Logging</h3>

<p>
  DWR works in JDK 1.3 where there is no java.util.logging and I don't wish to
  force DWR users to include a logging jar file what you might not otherwise
  need, so DWR does all it's logging using HttpServlet.log() methods. App.
  servers handle this logging in various ways although not all of them allow
  it to be configured and few finely so you can configure DWR using logging
  levels that are familiar to log4j users.
  <br/>
  The following stanza controls DWR logging:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;init-param&gt;
 &lt;param-name&gt;logLevel&lt;/param-name&gt;
 &lt;param-value&gt;DEBUG&lt;/param-value&gt;
&lt;/init-param&gt;
</pre>

<p>
  The valid values are: FATAL, ERROR, WARN (the default), INFO and DEBUG.
</p>

<h3>Overriding the default Creator and Converter Managers</h3>

<p>
  Advanced users may wish to override the default creator and converter
  managers. This can be achieved by adding one of the following init-params:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;init-param&gt;
 &lt;param-name&gt;converterManager&lt;/param-name&gt;
 &lt;param-value&gt;your.impl.of.ConverterManager&lt;/param-value&gt;
&lt;/init-param&gt;
&lt;init-param&gt;
 &lt;param-name&gt;creatorManager&lt;/param-name&gt;
 &lt;param-value&gt;your.impl.of.CreatorManager&lt;/param-value&gt;
&lt;/init-param&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Details to add to your dwr.xml</h2>

<p>
  As noted above there can be more than one dwr.xml file, with the entries in
  each being added together. This ability is used by DWR to load the basic
  config file to get everyone started.
  <br/>
  We can get a good introduction to dwr.xml files by looking at the standard
  config file that everyone gets for free.
</p>

<p>
  The DWR DOCTYPE line should be included in all dwr.xml files.
  It looks like this:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE dwr PUBLIC
    "-//GetAhead Limited//DTD Direct Web Remoting 0.4//EN"
    "http://www.getahead.ltd.uk/dwr/dwr.dtd"&gt;
</pre>

<p>
  The overall structure of dwr.xml is as follows:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;dwr&gt;
  &lt;init&gt;
    &lt;creator id="..." class="..."/&gt;
    &lt;converter id="..." class="..."/&gt;
  &lt;/init&gt;
  &lt;allow&gt;
    &lt;convert .../&gt;
    &lt;create .../&gt;
  &lt;/allow&gt;
&lt;/dwr&gt;
</pre>

<p>
  One slightly tricky bit of terminology - parameters are converted, but the
  remoted beans are created. So if you have a bean A with a method
  <code>blah(B)</code> then you need a creator for A and a converter for B.
</p>
<p>
  The optional init section declares the classes that can be used to create
  beans to remote and the classes that can be used to convert beans in the
  marshalling process.
</p>
<p>
  Having an entry in the init section just tells DWR about the existance of the
  class and gives it some basic detail about how it works. It does not bring it
  into use. In this way it is a bit like an import statement in Java. Most
  classes must be imported before use, but just having an import does not mean
  that the class is being used. Each creator and converter has an id attribute
  to allow it to be referred to later on.
</p>
<p>
  The allow section defines which classes DWR can create and convert. For each
  class that we allow we have a 'create' or 'convert' line. By default all of
  the following are converted for you without further declaration:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>All primitive types, boolean, int, double, etc.</li>
  <li>The Class based versions of the these Boolean, Integer, etc.</li>
  <li>java.lang.String</li>
  <li>java.util.Date and the 3 SQL derivatives</li>
  <li>arrays of the above</li>
  <li>Collections of the above (with some limitations)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  However nothing is added to the list of classes that can be created (i.e. put
  up for remoting) without you declaring it.
</p>

<h3>The 'new' Creator</h3>
<p>
  The new creator is declared by default by DWR as follows:
  <code>&lt;creator id="new" class="uk.ltd.getahead.dwr.create.NewCreator"/&gt;</code>
  You don't need to add this line to your dwr.xml because it is already in the
  DWR's internal dwr.xml file.
</p>
<p>
  This creator will create an instance of a class using the default constructor.
  The overhead of creating a new instance of your remoted object for every
  javascript call has got much less with later VMs so this inefficiency is
  probably not an issue for you. You can think of classes created using the
  'new' creator like stateless session beans if you know about EJBs.
  There are several benefits to using the 'new' creator:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Security: The shorter lived the objects created by DWR the less chance
    that they can be exploited by loading them up with invalid values in one
    call and then the invalid values fired at something that wasn't expecting
    it in another.
  </li>
  <li>
    Low memory overhead: If you have a site with many users, then you don't
    run the risk of running out of VM memory so much
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  You allow DWR to use the new creator to create and remote your beans as
  follows:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;allow&gt;
  &lt;create creator="new" javascript="Blah"&gt;
    &lt;param name="class" value="java.util.Date"/&gt;
  &lt;/create&gt;
  ... other definitions
&lt;/allow&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  This uses the 'new' creator defined above and gives it the Javascript name
  <code>Blah</code> so whenever in Javascript you call <code>Blah.toString(reply)</code>
  then a new java.util.Date will be constructed using the default constructor,
  then the toString() method will be called, and the data returned to the
  javascript reply function (in this case the current date in string form).
</p>

<h3>The 'session' Creator</h3>
<p>
  The session creator is declared by default by DWR as follows:
  <code>&lt;creator id="session" class="uk.ltd.getahead.dwr.create.SessionCreator"/&gt;</code>
  As with 'new' you don't need to add this line to your dwr.xml
</p>
<p>
  This creator will first search in the users session for a bean by the given
  javascript name, (creating it using the default constructor any placing it in
  the session if it isn't there) before proceeding as the 'new' creator.
  You can think of 'session' created beans as being like stateful session beans.
</p>
<p>
  You allow DWR to use the session creator to create and remote your beans as
  follows:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;allow&gt;
  ...
  &lt;create creator="session" javascript="TestBean"&gt;
    &lt;param name="class" value="your.stateful.JavaBean"/&gt;
  &lt;/create&gt;
  ... other definitions
&lt;/allow&gt;
</pre>

<h3>The 'spring' Creator</h3>
<p>
  The spring creator is declared by default by DWR as follows:
  <code>&lt;creator id="spring" class="uk.ltd.getahead.dwr.create.SpringCreator"/&gt;</code>
  As with 'new' you don't need to add this line to your dwr.xml
</p>
<p>
  This creator will lookup beans in your spring beans.xml file and use Spring
  to create them. This creator will be very useful to you if you already use
  Spring and totally useless if you don't.
</p>
<p>
  You allow DWR to use the spring creator to create and remote your beans as
  follows:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;allow&gt;
  ...
  &lt;create
      creator="spring"
      javascript="Fred"&gt;
    &lt;param name="beanName" value="Shiela"/&gt;
    &lt;param name="location" value="beans.xml"/&gt;
  &lt;/create&gt;
&lt;/allow&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  This causes DWR to look for a bean in a Spring Bean Factory.
  The location parameter is optional. If it is missing then you are expected to
  have declared the location of your Spring beans using the standard spring
  <b>WEB-INF/web.xml</b> configuration system:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;context-param&gt;
  &lt;param-name&gt;contextConfigLocation&lt;/param-name&gt;
  &lt;param-value&gt;/WEB-INF/classes/beans.xml&lt;/param-value&gt;
&lt;/context-param&gt;
&lt;listener&gt;
  &lt;listener-class&gt;
    org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener
  &lt;/listener-class&gt;
&lt;/listener&gt; 
</pre>
<p>
  If you prefer to specify which beans.xml to use in your dwr.xml file then you
  can use a location* parameter. You can specify as many as you wish although
  the names must be unique and start 'location'. For example: location-1,
  location-2. These locations are used as parameters to a Spring
  ClassPathXmlApplicationContext.
  <br/>
  The spring creator also supports the now deprecated resourceName parameter
  (which you can still use as a parameter as previously) however this use
  will be removed soon.
</p>
<p>
  DWR does not have a runtime (or compile time) dependency on Spring so if you
  don't use Spring then you won't be affected by this.
</p>
<p>
  I would welcome submissions of Creators designed for HiveMind, Pico, etc.
</p>

<h3>The 'static' Creator</h3>
<p>
  The static creator is declared by default by DWR as follows:
  <code>&lt;creator id="static" class="uk.ltd.getahead.dwr.create.StaticCreator"/&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>
  This creator is the simplest of all. It assumes that you will be calling
  static methods only, so no object creation is needed.
</p>
<p>
  You allow DWR to use the static creator to create and remote your beans as
  follows:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;allow&gt;
  ...
  &lt;create creator="static"
      javascript="Jim"
      class="your.class.with.static.Methods"/&gt;
  ... other definitions
&lt;/allow&gt;
</pre>

<h3>The Default Converters</h3>
<p>
  There are a number of converters that are defined and initialized for you.
  They are defined as follows:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;converter id="null"
    class="uk.ltd.getahead.dwr.convert.NullConverter"/&gt;
&lt;converter id="primitive"
    class="uk.ltd.getahead.dwr.convert.PrimitiveConverter"/&gt;
&lt;converter id="string"
    class="uk.ltd.getahead.dwr.convert.StringConverter"/&gt;
&lt;converter id="array"
    class="uk.ltd.getahead.dwr.convert.ArrayConverter"/&gt;
&lt;converter id="map"
    class="uk.ltd.getahead.dwr.convert.MapConverter"/&gt;
&lt;converter id="collection"
    class="uk.ltd.getahead.dwr.convert.CollectionConverter"/&gt;
&lt;converter id="date"
    class="uk.ltd.getahead.dwr.convert.DateConverter"/&gt;
&lt;converter id="bean"
    class="uk.ltd.getahead.dwr.convert.BeanConverter"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  The converters are mearly defined here and are put into use with
  &lt;convert&nbsp;...&gt; elements. There are 2 attributes in any convert element,
  a reference to a converter definition and a match line that defines the
  class(s) that it can convert.
</p>
<p>
  For example the simplest converter is the null converter that converts void
  and null values to javascript null and undefined vales.
  This creator is the simplest of all. It assumes that you will be calling
  static methods only, so no object creation is needed.
</p>
<p>
  By default DWR marshalls Java void values into Javascript nulls using the
  following: <code>&lt;convert converter="null" match="void"/&gt;</code>. There
  are times when a <code>java.lang.Void</code> needs to be converted as well so
  the same converter is used for those too:
  <code>&lt;convert converter="null" match="java.lang.Void"/&gt;</code>.
  There is no danger in passing nulls from Java to Javascript so these
  definitions are made by default - you don't need to put them in the &lt;allow&gt;
  section yourself.
</p>
<p>
  The primitive converter converts boolean, byte, char, etc as well as their
  Class based alternatives Boolean etc. The default setup includes 16 entries
  in the allow section for all primitive types along the following lines:
  <code>&lt;convert converter="primitive" match="java.lang.Long"/&gt;</code> and
  <code>&lt;convert converter="primitive" match="long"/&gt;</code>.
</p>
<p>
  The string and date converters are also setup by default. We have not found
  any way to subvert Strings, Dates or basic numeric types so they are all
  turned on by default.
</p>
<p>
  The array entries are less obvious. By default DWR marshalls arrays of all
  primitive types as well as arrays of all marshallable objects, which by
  default includes String and Date as noted previously.
  <br/>
  Advanced Java programmers will probably recognise why the match line is a
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html#getName()">little strange</a>.
</p>
<pre>
&lt;convert converter="array" match="[Z"/&gt;
&lt;convert converter="array" match="[B"/&gt;
&lt;convert converter="array" match="[S"/&gt;
&lt;convert converter="array" match="[I"/&gt;
&lt;convert converter="array" match="[J"/&gt;
&lt;convert converter="array" match="[F"/&gt;
&lt;convert converter="array" match="[D"/&gt;
&lt;convert converter="array" match="[C"/&gt;
&lt;convert converter="array" match="[L*"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  The * is not explained by the link above - it is a wildcard that matches any
  following string, which is how DWR can marshall arrays of any type that is
  marshallable by other means.
</p>
<p>
  The final 2 default converters are for maps and collections:
  <code>&lt;convert converter="collection" match="java.util.Collection"/&gt;</code>
  and <code>&lt;convert converter="map" match="java.util.Map"/&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>
  There is a catch for these 2 however. While there is no special version of
  DWR for JDK 1.5 there is no way of knowing the underlying type of the
  collection. So the 2 converters above can convert from any collection to
  something meaningful in Javascript, there is no way to know what sort of
  Collection to convert <b>to</b> going the other way.
  <br/>
  Since we can't work it out automatically we may need to have some special
  syntax in the dwr.xml file to allow us to hint types to the conversion process.
</p>
<p>
  The one converter that is not enabled by use is the Bean converter. This will
  convert POJOs into Javascript associative arrays and back again. This
  converter is not enabled by default for security reasons. If you have a bean
  that you have remoted using a &lt;create&nbsp;...&gt; statement, where one of the
  parameters is a bean with a setter that has some nasty side effects, then it
  would be possible for an attacker to cause the nasty side effects to happen.
  <br/>
  Time will tell whether this is overly paranoid or sensible, but for the moment
  we are leaving it out. You can enable it with one of the following:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;convert
    converter="bean"
    match="your.full.package.BeanName"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  To allow conversion of a single class. Or:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;convert
    converter="bean"
    match="your.full.package.*"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  To allow conversion of any class in the given package. Or:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;convert
    converter="bean"
    match="*"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  To enable conversion of any java classes. <b>Use at your own risk</b>.
  Actually you use any of DWR at your own risk, but especially this as it seems
  dangerous to the author.
