<h1>DWR - Hints and Tips</h1>

<h2>DWR and Spring</h2>

<p>
  A quick check-list of things to do to get DWR working with Spring:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Make sure you are on the latest DWR.
    You can tell which version of DWR this site is using by clicking on the
    query server button on the <a href="demo-text.html">dynamic text demo</a>.
    Recent versions of DWR have make error reporting much better so an upgrade
    is often worth it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure you are happy with everything on the
    <a href="intro.html">introduction</a> page.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure your Spring beans work properly outside of DWR.
  </li>
  <li>
    Configure DWR to work with Spring. See the section on the spring creator
    (towards the bottom) of the <a href="config-howto.html">configuration</a>
    page.
  </li>
  <li>
    Look at the demo pages: http://localhost:8080/[YOUR-WEBAPP]/dwr to check
    that your spring beans appear.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Bram Smeets has written up <a href="http://bram.jteam.nl/?p=2">an interesting
  blog</a> on now to configure DWR using beans.xml in place of WEB-INF/web.xml.
</p>

<p>
  I would be interested in working out how to specify dwr.xml in beans.xml as
  well, although this will take a fair bit of Spring-fu to do. Does anyone
  know much about how to make this happen? If so please join one of the
  <a href="https://dwr.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">mailing lists</a>
  and tell me about it.
