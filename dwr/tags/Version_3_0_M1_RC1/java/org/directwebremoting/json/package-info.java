/**
This package includes an implementation of the JSON spec in Java.

<p>The JSON spec includes the types object, array, number, string and boolean.
We have chosen to use the Java types String and boolean to represent the last
2 of these, and a choice of int, long and double for number. The object and
array types are implemented especially by {@link JsonObject} and
{@link JsonArray}.
