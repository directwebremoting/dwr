XHR headers
	I also read a recent posted question on setting
	headers, and you asked why it was needed.	
	Let me explain where I see a need.
	At our site, we use Spring and Acegi where we have
	written and/or use Acegi filters that look at the
	request authentication information in the request
	header.  Typically this is WSSE authentication
	information.
	As I started to look at DWR, I wanted to continue to
	leverage this capability, but to do so, I would need
	to set the request headers with the appropriate
	information.  If successful the filter will just pass
	the information to the DWR servlet for processing.
	Can you tell me if there is a way in either version of
	DWR to set this information? Of if you see another way
	around this, that would be helpful.

Simple Date format
	There are also notes here:
	http://getahead.ltd.uk/dwr/server/dwrxml/converters
	This is something that keeps on being mentioned. At some stage maybe we
	should consider creating a simple Javascript version of SimpleDateFormat
	that would help people get this job done more quickly.

Add checks for Javascript reserved names
	In using DWR one nasty issue I came across was that my bean had a property
	called default - my ajax call kept failing and I couldn't figure out why
	till I looked at the generated variables and saw that it was because the
	generated code put in a value for default and javascript didn't like it.
	Maybe as a warning, look at bean properties and see if there are a conflicts
	with reserved keywords.
