/**
 * Util is a server-side proxy that allows Java programmers to call client
 * side Javascript from Java.
 * <p>
 * Each Util object is associated with a list of ScriptSessions and the
 * proxy code is creates will be dynamically forwarded to all those browsers.
 * <p>
 * Currently this class contains only the write-only DOM manipulation functions
 * from Util. It is possible that we could add the read methods, however
 * the complexity in the callback and the fact that you are probably not going
 * to need it means that we'll leave it for another day. Specifically,
 * <code>getValue</code>, <code>getValues</code> and <code>getText</code> have
 * been left out as being read functions and <code>useLoadingMessage</code> etc
 * have been left out as not being DOM related.
