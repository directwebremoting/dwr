safari bug
	More info:
	Safari 417 (the current version on 10.4.3) is still a broken version, but
	engine.js set the broken flag is the version is < 417.
	When the isBrokenSafari2 parameter is set, it goes at the end of the
	request, so the request contains a single parameter named callCount, with
	value: (e.g)
	'1
	c0-scriptName=DraftAjax
	c0-methodName=getDraftSaveInterval
	c0-id=345_1136951956888
	xml=true
	isBrokenSafari2=true'

	Remember that currently we can remove: batch.map.isBrokenSafari2 = "true";
	from engine.js

Breaking changes:
	DWRUtil.getValue uses innerText in place of innerHTML for divs for consistency
		Actually is this a good thing?
	Changes to Converter API

Removal of string in place of function option in DWRUtil.addRows

-- Low Priority ----------------------------------------------------------------

url re-writing not supported
	I ended up having to extract DWREngine._sendData into a jsp and changing the
	call to be thus:
		batch.req.open("POST", batch.path + "/exec/" + statsInfo + "<html:rewrite href=''/>", true);
	so that the <html:rewrite would add the jsessionid

-- Ignore ----------------------------------------------------------------------

iframe when activex is off
	auto-fallback from xhr to iframe
		DWR works fine unless security is really crazy

problems with oc4j??
	This is a berif description and I will send you my code soon.
	In my code I'm trying to call a java method from the jscript, where the java
	method returns a vector of objects and the returned value is reterived from
	the database, so every time the returned vector size could be changed, but
	in my case the returned vector has the same size every time however I'm sure
	that this vector is changed. What I could understand till now that this
	problem still accoured even I have restarted the jDeveloper and the whole
	windows.
	Thank you for your interest, and I will send you the code ASAP.

IFrame GET is broken with Safari
	iframe is only really useful with IE6 (with activex turned off) so we can
	ignore this breakage

everything.js
	A script that gets all the bits in one lump
	Do we need a dojo.require thing?

-- Fixed -----------------------------------------------------------------------

call level metadata isn't merged into batch properly
