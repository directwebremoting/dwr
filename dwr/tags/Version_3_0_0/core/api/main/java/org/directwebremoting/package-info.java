This package contains all the classes that are interesting to DWR users going
about normal DWR business.

<p>It is entirely possible to use DWR without using any of these classes,

will need to use {@link org.directwebremoting.ScriptSession}s, and you get
access so this and other key classes using {@link org.directwebremoting.WebContext}
and {@link org.directwebremoting.WebContextFactory} or using
{@link org.directwebremoting.ServerContext} and
{@link org.directwebremoting.ServerContextFactory}.</p>

<ul>
<li>The JavaScript proxy classes are stored in org.directwebremoting.proxy.*</li>
<li>Various event classes are in org.directwebremoting.event.*</li>
<li>The {@link org.directwebremoting.io.FileTransfer} is in org.directwebremoting.io<li>
