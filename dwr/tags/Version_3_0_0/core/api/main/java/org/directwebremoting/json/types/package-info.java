/**
This package includes an implementation of the JSON spec in Java.

<p>The JSON spec includes the types object, array, number, string and boolean.
All of these types have objects to represent them however JsonValue has
getters to allow you to get at the more natural types with ease. The object and
array types are implemented especially by {@link JsonObject} and
{@link JsonArray}.
