This 'extend' package contains many of the classes that are interesting to very
advanced DWR users, and people embedding or extending DWR.

Files in this package are not subject to the same backwards compatibility ideals
as the <code>org.directwebremoting</code> package, however the code could change
in a backwards-incompatible way, so these classes should be avoided unless
necessary.
