<h2>Fixing Issues</h2>

<h3><a name="missingConverter">Warning: No Converter for XXX.</a></h3>
<p>
  dwr.xml does not have an allow entry that enables conversion of this type to
  Javascript. The most common cause of this problem is that XXX is a java bean
  and bean marshalling has not been enabled. Bean marshalling is disabled by
  default for security reasons.
</p>
<p>
  To enable marshalling for a given bean add the following line to the allow
  section of your dwr.xml file:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;convert converter="bean" match="XXX"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  It is also possible to enable marshalling for an entire package or hierachy
  of packages using the following:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;convert converter="bean" match="package.name.*"/&gt;
</pre>

<h3><a name="overloadedMethod">Warning: overloaded methods are not recommended</a></h3>
<p>
  Javascript does not support overloaded methods, so the javascript file
  generated from this class will contain two methods the second of which will
  replace the first. This is probably not what you wanted.
</p>
<p>
  It is best to avoid overloaded methods when using DWR.
</p>
<p>
  Java 5 presents an interesting challenge for finding overloaded methods and
  an issue to be aware of when using generics. From Java 5 on, co-variant
  return types are allowed, but the Class.getMethods() function will return
  2 methods, if you are making use of this feature, which can lead to false
  positives when detecting overloaded methods.
</p>
<p>
  It will be obvious to you if you really do have overloaded methods, but it is
  worth being aware of this small limitation in DWR 1.1 with Java 5. Calling
  the method will work just fine, but this page may incorrectly report an
  overloaded method.
