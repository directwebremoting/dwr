<h2>DWR (Direct Web Remoting)</h2>

<p>What DWR does for you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    DWR you a very very easy way to call Java code from your web-app.
    It gets  rid of almost all the boiler plate code between the web browser and
    your Java code.
    So you don't need to create servlets and web.xml entries for all your code,
    you don't need struts config files or JSF magic incantations, no writing
    Actions or implementing some special interface.
    Just you, DWR, Java, HTML and Javascript.
  </li>
  <li>
    DWR gives you a jump-start to being able to create GMail type interactivity.
    We are gradually moving to a web where more and more is done dynamically,
    and love it or lothe it that means Javascript. DWR makes the Javascript
    easier by giving you a set of examples of how to create dynamic sites.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What DWR does not do for you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    It is not a servlet framework. If you are already using Struts, JSF,
    Webwork or Spring, then DWR fits in just fine. It comes with Spring beans
    integration allowing you to remote your spring beans to Javascript.
  </li>
  <li>
    This is early days, however DWR has proved stable in a number of scenarios
    and it has a decent set of unit tests that give some degree of confidence
    as to bits that work well and bits that work badly.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Finding out more ...</h3>
<p>
  The project is hosted by Sun at
  <a href="https://dwr.dev.java.net">Java.net</a> which is also
  the best place for 
  <a href="https://dwr.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?expandFolder=2490&folderID=0">downloads</a>.  
</p>

<p>
  To help get started there is an
  <a href="intro.html">introduction documentation</a> on how to
  add the jar file to your webapp, and then
  <a href="config-howto.html">more detail on how to configure DWR</a> and a
  <a href="config-ref.html">reference section on dwr.xml</a>.
  <br/>
  There are 2 static (ish) Javascript files in addition to the files that are
  generated dynamically from your Java classes. engine.js and util.js are
  <a href="config-js.html">documented</a>.
  Please note the util.js is under review and will probably change so if you
  wish to make use of it you would be wise to copy it to your webapp first.
</p>

<h4>Worked Examples</h4>
<p>
  We have 4 working examples of using DWR to create:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="demo-text.html">Dynamic Text</a></li>
    <li><a href="demo-list.html">Selection Lists</a></li>
    <li><a href="demo-table.html">Live Tables</a></li>
    <li><a href="demo-form.html">Live Forms</a></li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>Unit Tests</h4>
<p>
  If you are running these pages from your own server then you will also find
  a working <a href="test.html">unit test page</a>. It won't work from my site
  because I don't wish to stress my server too much with hundreds of people
  running the same tests over and over again.
