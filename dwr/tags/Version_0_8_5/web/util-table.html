<h2>Generating Tables</h2>

<p><b>Elements</b>: table, thead, tbody, tfoot, tr, th, td
</p>

<p>
<b>See</b>: <code>DWRUtil.drawTable(tbodyID, data, cellFuncs)</code> and
<code>DWRUtil.clearChildNodes(tbodyID)</code>.
</p>

<p>
Tables can be cleared as above and added to using
<code>DWRUtil.drawTable(tbodyID, data, cellFuncs)</code>. DWRUtil.drawTable
encourages you to use tbody elements to support people that wish to have headers
or footers that are unchanged. Table rows can be created from arrays, but not
from strings, objects or numbers.
</p>

<p>
See the documentation for DWRUtil.drawTable() to see how a row is created for
each array entry and cells within the row are created by the calling of each
<code>cellFunc</code> using the array entry as a parameter.
</p>

<p>
Open questions: Should we support creation of tables from objects (using a
for/in loop?). Currently there is no plan to do this because there is no idea
of similarity between the properties of an object, but there is some concept
of this for an object. Similarly creation of a table from a string (via
innerHTML) may be possible using plain strings and setValue so we will not
attempt to support it here.
