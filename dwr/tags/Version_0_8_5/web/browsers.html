<h1>DWR Browser Support</h1>

<p>
  We would like help testing all browsers, so if you can provide more information
  on any of the browsers listed below, or on ones that are not, please join

      Very few people use version prior to 1.0 so although we believe that DWR
      has worked since version 0.7 we have no plans to begin testing with
      versions prior to 1.0

      You will probably be unaffected by this unless you are doing something
      very strange.
