<h1>util.js</h1>

<p>
util.js contains utility functions to do a number of things, some are
cross-browser tweaks (like checking for return in a text field, or selecting a
range of text in an input box), others are quick utilities (like the $()
function inspired by prototype that does getElementById()).
Most of these are fairly easy to understand.
</p>

<p>
util.js also contains a number of HTML manipultion functions which need a bit
more explanation. This document explains what manipulations are possible and
how to achieve them.
