  <title>DWR - Upgrading DWR</title>
</head>

<body>

<h2>Upgrading to DWR 0.8.5</h2>
<p>
  It has been true for a while, but it is worth noting the only attributes that
  are 100% correct for a <code>&lt;create ...</code> element are
  <code>creator="..."</code> and <code>javascript="..."</code>. Other common
  attributes like <code>class="..."</code> should be put as a nested param
  elements. E.g. <code>&lt;param name="class" value="..."/&gt;</code>
</p>

<h2>Upgrading to DWR 0.8</h2>
<p>
  There are even more <a href="changelog.html">new features</a> with this
  release. The biggest backwards incompatible change is to logging where the
  output is now more fine grained then before, so you might need to change
  your logging configuration to avoid being swamped.
</p>
<p>
  Also the Converter interface changed slightly to help pass on extra type info
  for Collections.
</p>

<h2>Upgrading to DWR 0.6</h2>
<p>
  There are plenty of <a href="changelog.html">new features with DWR 0.6</a>,
  however all changes are backwards compatible so no edits are required to your
  applications.
</p>

<h2>Upgrading to DWR 0.5</h2>
<p>
  All the functions in util.js and engine.js are now 'static class' functions.
  The old versions are deprecated, and you will get a warning to move over as
  an alert box. The new versions should have less chance of name clashes.
</p>

<p>
  The Spring Creator has been given an overhall. The resourceName parameter is
  deprecated, and will be removed soon. It is probably best to look at the
  <a href="spring.html">configration documentation</a> to see how the new
  version works.
</p>

<h2>Upgrading to DWR 0.4</h2>
<p>
  web/WEB-INF/web.xml has a fully fleshed out example of the options for dwr.
  2 parameters (config and logLevel) you can safely ignore.
  The 3rd, debug, you should leave as true if you want the test/debug setup to
  work (this is what you are using below)
  I would suggest turning this off in live.
</p>

<p>
  Secondly you will need a dwr.xml file that does the job of the old allow
  parameter. By default it lives in WEB-INF/dwr.xml (there is an example in the
  web folder of this too)
  <br/>
  I suggest starting with the example in the web/WEB-INF folder and removing
  the &lt;init&gt; section and for each allow have a
  &lt;create creator="new" javascript="Test" class="full.java.pkg.Test"/&gt; tag.
  <br/>
  The different type of creators allow us to have different sources for the
  beans. <code>new</code> was all that existed in dwr 0.3. <code>session</code>
  gets the bean from the session (creating it if it does not exist).
  <code>spring</code> uses the spring framework and <code>static</code> works on
  static methods only.
  <br/>
  You can remove all the converter options in the allow section.
  By default all primitive types, arrays and Strings get converted without need
  for declaration. The system dwr file in <code>java/uk/ltd/getahead/dwr</code>
  might help you see what is going on a bit.
</p>

<p>
  There is one other breaking change, where in your html you were doing:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='/XXX/dwr/interface/full.java.pkg.Test.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  You would need to do:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='/XXX/dwr/interface/Test.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  Where Test is the value you specify in the javascript attribute in your create tag (see above).
