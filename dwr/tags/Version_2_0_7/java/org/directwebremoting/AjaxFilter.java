 * <li>Data cleansing - remove private data</li>
 * <li>Logging filters - when you need specific logging action</li>

     * the filter to pass on method details to next entity in the chain.
     * <p>Typically the method would do the following:</p>
     * <ol>
     * <li>Examine the request</li>
     * <li>Optionally alter the method, object or parameters</li>
     * <li>Either invoke the next entity in the chain using the AjaxFilterChain
     * or decide to take some other action instead.</li>
     * <li>Optionally modify the value returned to the user</li>
     * <li>Take some other action (e.g. logging)</li>
     * </ol>

     * @param method The method to execute
     * @param params The parameters to the method call
     * @param chain Allow the request to be passed on
     * @return The results of the method execution
     * @throws IOException When some I/O error occurs
     * @throws Exception When some processing goes wrong
